Set up machines on cybera Rac. One machine with floating ip will act as the master node the the rest will act as slave nodes

#(For Old releases) Copy installSparkWithJava8.sh on each machine 

(For Latest Realease) Copy updatedinstallSparkWithJava8.sh on each machine    

On each machine run: updatedinstallSparkWithJava8.sh

On each machine run: source ~/.bashrc

verify spark installation by running : pyspark

enable passwordless ssh and set up ~/.ssh/config  and /etc/hosts files

on master change the /etc/hosts file as shown in hosts file. *Replace all the IP and node names with your cluster node names and IP's

on master change the ~/.ssh/config file as shown in config file. *Replace all the IP and node names with your cluster node names and IP's

Run setupssh.py on Master node 

Your Cluster is all Set up

on Master Run: startMaster.sh

Open PublicIP:8080 to see the Spark Web UI

on Workers Run: startSlave.sh SPARK_MASTER_URL
